<details><summary>show steps</summary>
once setup is complete, follow these instructions to create the necessary CFN files

2. double-clicking "CFN_file.py" will launch the application. Alternatively, you can right-click it, select "create shortcut", and move the shortcut to the desktop for easier access. DO NOT move the .py files themselves
